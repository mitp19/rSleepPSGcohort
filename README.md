## Description

This package makes it easier to do cohort analysis of participants that take part insleep polysomnography (PSG) studies. The package has the ability to take technician scored polysomnography data files of individual participants, create cohorts from these participants and compute summary metrics and visuals on a individual participant and cohort-level.

## Installation

The package can be installed with the following code snippet from Github:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mitp19/rSleepPSGcohort", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("rSleepPSGcohort")
```

## Overview

``` r
ls("package:rSleepPSGcohort")
data(package = "rSleepPSGcohort") # optional
```

`rSleepPSGcohort` contains 2 functions to help aggregate and visualize human-scored scored sleep data. *ProcessData* takes a directory of sleep PSG XML files and combines the key metrics into a dataframe. *VisualizeSummaryMetrics* takes the output from *ProcessData*, returning a visual of total sleep time, wake time and night time for each individual.

The package tree structure is provided below.

## Contributions

The author of this package is Mit Patel. The *ProcessData* functions uses the *XML* package to read XML data files and convert them to data fames. The *VisualizeSummaryMetrics* does data visualization with the ggplot2 library.
